# AppleStore
An analysis of over 7000 apps from the Apple Store. This project includes data cleaning, exploration, and analysis. This project also includes numerous datasets and four of them are 
combined into one. As a dataset and in what is relevant to us, the first dataset, AppleStore, that is not combined with any others gives us ids, app names, user ratings, primary genres, 
and price of every app included on the list. On the other hand, the second dataset, appleStore_description_combined, that is the combination of four seperate datasets only gives us
the ids once again, app names once again, and app description of every app included on the list. Both datasets consist of the same list of apps.
